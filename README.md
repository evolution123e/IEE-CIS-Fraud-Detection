# IEE-CIS-Fraud-Detection

I will include my notes for the kaggle competition IEE-CIS fraud detection here. To obey the competition rules this can be done only if I upload them first as a Kaggel notebook. I will be able to upload all my files after 01/10/2019 before this it will only contain EDA and some quick and dirty models.
